# Drill-Engineering
A typical project in drilling a well.

In this project, we calculate this properties:
1. The length of the drill collar
2. Weight of drill string at air
3. Volume of required mud to fill surface mud reservoir, drill string and hole.
4. Weight of desired mud to overcome pore pressure. (By considering 100 psi for 
overbalanced pressure margin)
5. The sacks of barite and volume of fresh water in bbl. (By using barite as weighting agent.)
And Visulize:
1. Mud pressure profile at static condition.
2. Axial tension vs. depth for drill string.
3. Volume of pumped mud vs. time

Use the following data:
o A vertical well with 10,000 ft depth.
o Drill pipe:
▪ 5 in. OD; 4.276 in. ID; 19.5 lbm/ft.
o Drill collar:
▪ 5 in. OD; 2.5 in. ID; 147 lbm/ft.
o Casing:
▪ Casing shoe: 7,000 ft;
▪ 9 ¾ in. OD; 8.625 in. ID; 59.20 lbm/ft;
o Required WOB: 59,000 lb.
o Pore pressure @ 10,000 ft: 6,000 psi.
o Mud pit and surface facility volume: 100 bbl.
o Pump Data:
▪ Triplex; 6.5 in. Liner; 18 in. Stroke; 3,000 psi; 20 stroke/min;
▪ Efficiency: 80%;
